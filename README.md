# Freelance Escrow Smart Contract

A decentralized escrow system for freelancers and clients, enabling secure transactions with dispute resolution via arbitrators.

## Project Overview

This project implements a smart contract that manages freelance job agreements. Clients post jobs with escrowed funds, freelancers submit work, and disputes are resolved by staked arbitrators. Key features:

- **Job Lifecycle Management**: Post, accept, submit, and confirm jobs.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Multi-signature voting by arbitrators.
- **Security**: Reentrancy protection, access control, and safe ETH transfers.
